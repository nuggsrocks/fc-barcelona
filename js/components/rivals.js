            <p>
                There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league,
                and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Barcelona and Real Madrid is
                known as <em>El Cl&aacute;sico</em>. From the start of national competitions, the clubs
                were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Barcelona in Catalonia and Madrid in Castile.
                The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between Catalans and Castilians,
                and their disagreements over the monarchy.

                Bar&ccedil;a&apos;s local rival has always been Espanyol. Being one of the clubs granted
                royal patronage, Espanyol was founded exclusively by Spanish football fans, unlike the multinational
                nature of Bar&ccedil;a&apos;s formation. This led to a strengthened rivalry due to the <em>Barcelonistas</em>&apos;
                hatred and distrust of the Spanish crown. Meanwhile, the founding message of Espanyol was clearly
                anti-Barcelona, and they have disapprovingly viewed FC Barcelona as a team of foreigners.
                The rivalry is known as <em>El Derbi Barcelon&iacute;</em>.
