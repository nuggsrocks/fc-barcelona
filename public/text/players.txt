Spanish teams are limited to three players without EU citizenship. The squad list includes only the principal nationality of each player; several non-European players on the squad have dual citizenship with an EU country. Barcelona has employed many famous players, with five FIFA World Player of the Year award winners and six Ballon d'Or winners among the previous and current Barcelona players. This makes Barça the club with the most top player awards received all-time. In 2009, Barcelona won an unprecedented sextuple by winning La Liga, the Copa del Rey, the Supercopa de España, the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Supercup and the FIFA Club World Cup in one calendar year. The same year, five of their players and their coach were voted onto the UEFA Team of the Year 2009.
