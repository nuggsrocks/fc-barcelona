        In 1899, football pioneer Joan Gamper decided he wanted to form a
        football club. After eleven other enthusiasts responded to his newspaper
        advert, the dream became a reality and "Foot-Ball Club Barcelona" was
        born. The new club started off its journey successfully enough; after
        losing to Bizcaya in the final of the inaugural Copa del Rey in 1902,
        Barcelona bounced back in style by winning the competition eight times
        between then and 1928 (they were also successful in the regional
        Campionat de Catalunya). The following year, they clinched the inaugural
        La Liga before entering a period of decline due to the ongoing political
        conflicts in the country, which eventually grew so large that they
        resulted in the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War and the beginning of
        Francisco Franco's fascist regime. Gamper’s time in Barcelona ended
        abruptly after he was deported from Spain because of political reasons.
        A few years later he committed suicide. Josep Sunyol had become the new
        director of FC Barcelona. He was a left-wing politician and this would
        finally lead to his death; he was executed by the Francoist regime in
        1938.

        While life under Franco was proving arduous from a political point of
        view (the club was in fact forced to change its name to the more Spanish
        sounding “Barcelona Club de Futbol” and the Catalan colors were removed
        from the crest), the next two decades were reasonably successful for the
        club. In the period from 1942 to 1957, Barcelona claimed five La Liga
        titles and five Copa del Rey trophies. Following their move to the newly
        built Camp Nou, the club's officials decided to turn a new leaf and
        appoint Helenio Herrera as the new manager. Under Herrera's guidance –
        and with a Ballon d'Or winner Luis Suárez as the team's leader on the
        field – Barcelona won two consecutive La Ligas and one Copa del Rey in
        the next three years.

        In 1973 the Dutch star Johan Cruyff joined the club and was one of the
        reasons that the team managed to claim a La Liga title in 1974, the
        first in ten years. The waiting for the next league victory would again
        hang over ten years until the team with Terry Venables as manager could
        win another one. This era wasn't all doom and gloom for Barcelona,
        though, and the trophy collection would continue to increase rapidly
        since Barça were far more successful in the cup competitions. During
        this period, Barcelona won four Copa del Reys and two Cup Winners' Cups.
        In 1979, Cruyff came up with the idea of founding a football academy
        that would function on the same principles as the celebrated Ajax Youth
        Academy. His proposal was eventually accepted, and an old country
        building named La Masia was converted into the Academy headquarters. In
        the years that followed, La Masia became the most revered football
        academy in the entire world, known as much for its immaculate top-down
        organization as for the many players who passed through it and became
        stars. The list of La Masia-bred youngsters includes Josep "Pep"
        Guardiola, Cesc Fàbregas, Gerard Piqué, and Lionel Messi.

        The year of 1988 is notable for Cruyff's return to Barcelona, this time
        in a position of manager. He immediately showcased his eye for talent by
        assembling a so-called "Dream Team," combining home-grown players such
        as Pep Guardiola and Txiki Begiristain with international stars like
        Michael Laudrup, Romário and Hristo Stoichkov. Perhaps even more
        importantly, the football philosophy Cruyff brought with himself to the
        club served as a stepping stone to what would later become the
        “tiki-taka” system. Under Cruyff, Barcelona claimed four consecutive La
        Liga titles, two Copa del Rey trophies, one Cup Winners' Cup, as well as
        their first European Cup trophy. In addition to all his accomplishments
        while at Barcelona, Cruyff opened the club's door for other celebrated
        Dutch internationals. Barcelona's "Dutch connection" was at its most
        prominent during the 90s and early 2000s, with Ronald Koeman, Patrick
        Kluivert and Giovanni van Bronckhorst in particular leaving a big mark
        at the club. The Dutch influence did not end with their players, either;
        shortly after Cruyff's departure from the club in 1996, Louis van Gaal
        took over as manager and continued a streak of good results by leading
        Barcelona to two La Ligas, two Copa del Reys and one Cup Winners' Cup,
        all before the turn of the century. Losing Luís Figo – one of the club's
        heroes up until that point – to Real Madrid's "Los Galacticos" in 2000
        proved to be a tough blow for Barça and their ambitions.

        The early 2000s saw many changes in the club's personnel, but things
        didn't turn for the better until the arrival of another Dutchman in 2005
        – Frank Rijkaard. Much like his compatriots Cruyff and Van Gaal before
        him, Rijkaard went on to form a star-studded team by combining expensive
        international signings such as Ronaldinho with a base of upcoming
        Spanish players like Carles Puyol, Xavi Hernández and Andrés Iniesta.
        With Rijkaard in charge, Barcelona won two La Ligas and one Champions
        League.

        In 2008, Pep Guardiola took over as the club's manager, having
        previously coached Barcelona's B Team. Being a product of La Masia
        himself, Guardiola fully understood the importance of the Academy and
        the possibilities it holds. His coaching methods focused primarily on
        the now-famous “tiki-taka”, a style of play combined Cruyff's penchant
        for quick passing and constant movement with maintaining possession at
        all costs. In addition to that, this tactic favored zonal marking over
        the traditional, formation-based system. Soon enough, “tiki-taka” turned
        into a conceptual revolution in its own right, leaving Barcelona in a
        great position to profit off it. During his four years at the helm,
        Guardiola turned Barcelona into the most dominant club in the world. Led
        by La Masia's newest wunderkind, Lionel Messi, Barça went on to decimate
        any opposition in their path, winning three La Liga, two Copa del Rey
        and two Champions League titles from 2008 to 2012. Even after
        Guardiola's departure, Barcelona would stick to the successful formula;
        in the years that followed, they claimed an additional two La Ligas, one
        Copa del Rey and the 2015 Champions League.
