        The nickname &qout;culé&qout; for a Barcelona supporter is derived from the Catalan
        &qout;cul&qout; (English: arse), as the spectators at the first stadium, Camp de la
        Indústria, sat with their &qout;culés&qout; over the stand. In Spain, about 25% of
        the population is said to be Barça sympathisers, second behind archrival
        Real Madrid, supported by 32% of the population. Throughout Europe,
        Barcelona is the favourite second-choice club. The club&apos;s membership
        figures have seen a significant increase from 100,000 in the 2003-04
        season to 170,000 in September 2009. FC Barcelona is one of few modern day
        football teams to be owned by its members.

        In addition to membership, as of 2015 there are 1,267 officially
        registered fan clubs, called &qout;penyes&qout;, around the world. The fan clubs
        promote Barcelona in their locality and receive beneficial offers when
        visiting Barcelona. Among the best supported teams globally, Barcelona has
        the second highest social media following in the world among sports teams,
        with over 103 million Facebook fans as of December 2017, just behind Real
        Madrid.
