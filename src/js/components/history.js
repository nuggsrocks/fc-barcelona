            <p>
                In 1899, football pioneer <em>Joan Gamper</em> decided he wanted to form a football club.
                After eleven other enthusiasts responded to his newspaper advert, the dream became a reality and
                Foot-Ball Club Barcelona was born. The new club started off its journey successfully enough; after losing to Bizcaya
                in the final of the inaugural <em>Copa del Rey</em> in 1902, Barcelona
                bounced back in style by winning the competition eight times between then and 1928 (they were also
                successful in the regional <em>Campionat de Catalunya</em>).
                The following year, they clinched the inaugural <em>La Liga</em> before
                entering a period of decline due to the ongoing political conflicts in the country, which eventually
                grew so large that they resulted in the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War and the beginning of
                Francisco Franco&apos;s fascist regime.

            <p>
                <em>Gamper</em>’s time in Barcelona ended abruptly after he was deported from Spain
                because of political reasons. A few years later he committed suicide. <em>Josep Sunyol</em> had
                become the new director of FC Barcelona. He was a left-wing politician and this would finally lead
                to his death; he was executed by the Francoist regime in 1938.

            <p>
                While life under Franco was proving arduous from a political point of view (the club was in fact
                forced to change its name to the more Spanish sounding Barcelona Club de Futbol and the Catalan colors
                were removed from the crest), the next two decades were reasonably successful for the club. In the
                period from 1942 to 1957, Barcelona claimed five <em>La Liga</em> titles
                and five <em>Copa del Rey</em> trophies. Following their move to the newly
                built Camp Nou, the club&apos;s officials decided to turn a new leaf and
                appoint <em>Helenio Herrera</em> as the new manager. Under Herrera&apos;s guidance
                – and with a <em>Ballon d&apos;Or</em> winner <em>Luis Su&aacute;rez</em> as
                the team&apos;s leader on the field – Barcelona won two consecutive <em>La Ligas</em> and
                one <em>Copa del Rey</em> in
                the next three years.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1973 the Dutch star <em>Johan Cruyff</em> joined the club and was one of the
                reasons that the team managed to claim a <em>La Liga</em> title in 1974,
                the first in ten years. The waiting for the next league victory would again hang over ten years until
                the team with <em>Terry Venables</em> as manager could win another one.
                This era wasn&apos;t all doom and gloom for Barcelona, though, and the trophy collection would continue to
                increase rapidly since Bar&ccedil;a were far more successful in the cup competitions. During this period,
                Barcelona won four <em>Copa del Reys</em> and
                two <em>Cup Winners&apos; Cups</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1979, <em>Cruyff</em> came up with the idea of founding a football academy
                that would function on the same principles as the celebrated Ajax Youth Academy. His proposal was
                eventually accepted, and an old country building named La Masia was converted into the Academy
                headquarters. In the years that followed, La Masia became the most revered football academy in the
                entire world, known as much for its immaculate top-down organization as for the many players who
                passed through it and became stars. The list of La Masia-bred youngsters
                includes <em>Josep &quot;Pep&quot; Guardiola</em>, <em>Cesc F&agrave;bregas</em>, <em>Gerard Piqu&eacute;</em>, and <em>Lionel Messi</em>.
                The year of 1988 is notable for <em>Cruyff</em>&apos;s return to Barcelona, this time
                in a position of manager. He immediately showcased his eye for talent by assembling a so-called &quot;Dream Team,&quot;
                combining home-grown players such as <em>Pep Guardiol</em> and <em>Txiki Begiristain</em> with
                international stars like <em>Michael Laudrup</em>, <em>Rom&aacute;rio</em> and <em>Hristo Stoichkov</em>.
                Perhaps even more importantly, the football philosophy <em>Cruyff</em> brought with
                himself to the club served as a stepping stone to what would later become the tiki-taka system.
                Under <em>Cruyff</em>, Barcelona claimed four
                consecutive <em>La Liga</em> titles,
                two <em>Copa del Rey</em> trophies,
                one <em>Cup Winners&apos; Cup</em>, as well as their
                first <em>European Cup</em> trophy.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to all his accomplishments while at Barcelona, <em>Cruyff</em> opened
                the club&apos;s door for other celebrated Dutch internationals. Barcelona&apos;s &quot;Dutch connection&quot; was at its
                most prominent during the 90s and early 2000s, with <em>Ronald Koeman</em>, <em>Patrick Kluivert</em> and <em>Giovanni van Bronckhorst</em> in
                particular leaving a big mark at the club. The Dutch influence did not end with their players, either;
                shortly after Cruyff&apos;s departure from the club in 1996, <em>Louis van Gaal</em> took
                over as manager and continued a streak of good results by leading Barcelona to
                two <em>La Ligas</em>,
                two <em>Copa del Reys</em> and
                one <em>Cup Winners&apos; Cup</em>, all before the turn of the century.
            </p>
            <p>
                Losing <em>Lu&iacute;s Figo</em> – one of the club&apos;s heroes up until that point
                – to Real Madrid&apos;s &quot;Los Galacticos&quot; in 2000 proved to be a tough blow for Bar&ccedil;a and their
                ambitions. The early 00s saw many changes in the club&apos;s personnel, but things didn&apos;t turn for the
                better until the arrival of another Dutchman in 2005 – <em>Frank Rijkaard</em>.
                Much like his compatriots <em>Cruyff</em> and <em>Van Gaal</em> before
                him, <em>Rijkaard</em> went on to form a star-studded team by combining expensive
                international signings such as <em>Ronaldinho</em> with a base of upcoming Spanish
                players like <em>Carles Puyol</em>, <em>Xavi Hern&aacute;ndez</em> and <em>Andr&eacute;s Iniesta</em>.
                With <em>Rijkaard</em> in charge, Barcelona won two <em>La Ligas</em> and
                one <em>Champions League</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2008, <em>Pep Guardiola</em> took over as the club&apos;s manager, having previously
                coached Barcelona&apos;s B Team. Being a product of La Masia himself, <em>Guardiola</em> fully
                understood the importance of the Academy and the possibilities it holds. His coaching methods focused primarily
                on the now-famous tiki-taka, a style of play combined <em>Cruyff</em>&apos;s penchant
                for quick passing and constant movement with maintaining possession at all costs. In addition to that,
                this tactic favored zonal marking over the traditional, formation-based system. Soon enough, tiki-taka
                turned into a conceptual revolution in its own right, leaving Barcelona in a great position to profit off it
                During his four years at the helm, <em>Guardiola</em> turned Barcelona into the most
                dominant club in the world. Led by La Masia&apos;s newest wunderkind, <em>Lionel Messi</em>, Bar&ccedil;a
                went on to decimate any opposition in their path, winning
                three <em>La Liga</em>,
                two <em>Copa del Rey</em> and
                two <em>Champions League</em> titles from 2008 to 2012. Even
                after <em>Guardiola&apos;s</em> departure, Barcelona would stick to the successful
                formula; in the years that followed, they claimed an additional
                two <em>La Ligas</em>, one <em>Copa del Rey</em> and
                the 2015 <em>Champions League</em>.
