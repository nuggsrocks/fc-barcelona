The nickname <em>cul&eacute;</em> for a Barcelona
                supporter is derived from the Catalan <em>cul</em> (English: arse),
                as the spectators at the first stadium, Camp de la Ind&uacute;stria, sat with
                their <em>cul&eacute;s</em> over the stand. In Spain, about 25% of the population
                is said to be Bar&ccedil;a sympathisers, second behind archrival Real Madrid, supported by 32% of the population.
                Throughout Europe, Barcelona is the favourite second-choice club. The club&apos;s membership figures have
                seen a significant increase from 100,000 in the 2003&ndash;04 season to 170,000 in September 2009.
                FC Barcelona is one of few modern day football teams to be owned by its members.
