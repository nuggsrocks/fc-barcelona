                In terms of FC Barcelona, the club’s history can be clearly be divided into three main stages.
                In the early days, the club constantly switched between different grounds.
                In the second stage, the club was consolidated by finding a permanent home
                at <em className={'grounds'}>Les Corts</em> . And the third stage, and the construction of
                the <em className={'grounds'}>Camp Nou</em>, reflects the expansion and grandeur of the club
                on a global scale.
            </p>
            <p className={'barca-text'}>
                The old <em className={'grounds'}>Les Corts</em> ground, inaugurated in 1922, was remodelled several
                times in order to find room for Bar&ccedil;a’s constantly growing fan base. After the Spanish Civil
                War, the club started attracting more and more members every year, which also meant a considerably
                larger number of spectators at matches. This increased support was the inspiration for several
                expansion projects, of the south goal (1946), the north goal (1950), and the grandstand’s capacity
                (1944). But it was becoming patently evident that what the club really needed to do was build a
                completely new stadium, and therefore the board of directors combined these improvements
                to <em className={'grounds'}>Les Corts</em> with plans to make the dream of a new stadium
                a reality.
            </p>
            <p className={'barca-text'}>
                It is often said that what finally convinced the board that there was no other option than the
                construction of a new ground was the arrival of the now
                legendary <em className={'names'}>L&aacute;szl&oacute; Kubala</em>, one of the finest
                players ever to appear for FC Barcelona. And although there can be no doubting
                that <em className={'names'}>Kubala</em> attracted more interest than ever in the team and meant
                the club’s spirits hit a new high, the decision to build was inspired just as much by the two
                league titles won in 1947-48 and 1948-49, which was before the great Hungarian had signed for the club.
                In fact, the first solid step towards a new stadium came in September 1950, fifteen days
                before <em className={'names'}>Kubala</em> played his first friendly match wearing his new
                Bar&ccedil;a colors. It was then that the president of the time, Agust&iacute; Montal y Galobart,
                signed an option to purchase a site in the area known as La Maternidad, an option that was to be
                taken up just two months later.
            </p>
            <p className={'barca-text'}>
                What followed was a turbulent period, as the <em className={'grounds'}>Camp Nou</em> commission
                decided on February 9, 1951 to change the location of the future stadium to the area at the top
                of the Diagonal, and this led to a series of sterile negotiations with the authorities that did
                not seem to be getting anywhere. The matter seemed to have been shelved for good when Francesc
                Mir&oacute;-Sans won the FC Barcelona presidential elections on November 14, 1953. The new president
                was a fervent supporter of the idea of building a new stadium as soon as possible and one of the
                first things he did after coming into office on February 18, 1954 was to locate the future stadium
                on the site purchased in 1950, rather than at the top end of the Diagonal. And so, on March 28,
                before a crowd of 60,000 Bar&ccedil;a fans, the first stone of the
                future <em className={'grounds'}>Camp Nou</em> was laid in place under the presidency of civil
                governor Felipe Acedo Colunga and with the blessing of the Archbishop of Barcelona, Gregorio Modrego.
            </p>
            <p className={'barca-text'}>
                The architects of the new stadium were Francesc Mitjans Mir&oacute;, cousin of Mir&oacute;-Sans, and
                Josep Soteras Mauri, with the collaboration of Lorenzo Garc&iacute;a Barb&oacute;n. More than a year
                later, on July 11, 1955, the club commissioned the construction work to the INGAR SA company, who
                estimated the project at 66,620,000 pesetas, claiming it would take 18 months to complete. However,
                the stadium would eventually cost an awful lot more than the original estimate, eventually totalling
                around 288 million pesetas (roughly $42 million USD today), an amount that would need to be covered
                by successive issues of mortgage obligations and short term bonds. This measure meant the
                construction of the stadium could be financed, but would leave the club in heavy debt for many
                years after.
            </p>
            <p className={'barca-text'}>
                When it was opened, <em className={'grounds'}>Camp Nou</em> had a capacity of 93,053 (the old project
                for a capacity of 150,000 had been abandoned) and the pitch measured 107x72 metres (it currently
                measures 105x68 to fulfill UEFA requirements). The principal materials used in its construction
                were iron and concrete and since 1957 the stadium has undergone several refurbishments. Amongst
                the most notable were the installation of floodlighting in 1959, the arrival of the electronic
                scoreboard in 1976 and the construction of the VIP area and press box which came during the 1981/82
                season. In 1982 the stadium’s capacity was increased by 22,150 with the addition of the third tier
                of seating, giving <em className={'grounds'}>Camp Nou</em> room for some 115,000 fans. The stadium
                played host that year to the opening ceremony and first game of the World Cup. Two years later in
                1984 the Club Museum was added to the stadium. In 1994, more work was carried out as the pitch was
                lowered by 2.5 metres to allow the lower seating area to be expanded, the conversion of standing
                areas behind the goals into seated areas and the removal of the moat from around the pitch. Before
                the century was out the standing areas were turned into seating thus reducing the stadium’s capacity
                to its present day figure of 99,000.
